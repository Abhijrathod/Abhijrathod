I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Linux <a href="https://stars.github.com/Abhijrathod">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the Engineering ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.jrabhijrathod@gmail.com/">Mail me </a>, a community for Engineering and non-binary Software developers.
